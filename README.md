# ReportMyTeam
Your teammates are at fault? Let me help you reporting them! (they are at fault.)
As long as the app keeps running it will report all players at the end of every game, with the exception of your friends.

## Features
- Automatically reports all your teammates and enemies when the game ends
- Ignores players from your friendslist
- Reports players with low KP as well as players who are too low level for being afk
- Reports players with low KDA for intentionally feeding
- Reports everyone else for being toxic because they all are, it's league

## Note
- If the application fails to launch, chances are you don't have .NET Runtime installed. You can find the latest version at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0
